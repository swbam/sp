## 📊 NAVIGATION HEALTH METRICS

### Current Status: **86% SUCCESS RATE**
- **Navigation Routes**: 3/5 passed (60%)
- **Navigation Components**: 5/5 found (100%)
- **Error Pages**: 4/4 found (100%)
- **Overall System Health**: GOOD ✅

### Route Status Details:
- ✅ **Homepage** (`/`) - 200 OK
- ✅ **Search Page** (`/search`) - 200 OK  
- ✅ **Shows Page** (`/shows`) - 200 OK
- ⚠️ **Account Page** (`/account`) - 404 (Expected - needs auth)
- ✅ **Invalid Routes** - 404 (Expected - proper error handling)
