FROM shows 
JOIN artists ON shows.artist_id = artists.id
JOIN venues ON shows.venue_id = venues.id
JOIN setlists ON setlists.show_id = shows.id

## ‚ùå ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Critical Issues (Must Fix):
1. **Database Functions Missing:** search_artists, get_setlist_with_votes, get_user_vote functions not found in schema cache
   - **Impact:** API endpoints that depend on these functions will fail
   - **Solution:** Re-run migration script or manually create functions
2. **RLS Policy Gap:** Public write access not properly blocked  
   - **Impact:** Security vulnerability allowing unauthorized data modification
   - **Solution:** Implement proper authentication-based policies
3. **Vote Trigger Issue:** Foreign key constraints preventing test vote operations
   - **Impact:** Voting system may not work with real authentication
   - **Solution:** Test with actual authenticated users

### Minor Issues (Should Fix):
1. **Auth UUID Format:** Voting system expects proper UUID format for user_id
2. **Function Parameter Order:** Database functions have parameter order issues  
3. **Storage Session Warnings:** Supabase client persistence warnings
4. **Performance Degradation:** Some index queries slower than expected (100-190ms vs target <50ms)

---

## üîß RECOMMENDED FIXES

### 1. Database Functions (High Priority)
```sql
-- Re-run the database migration to ensure functions are created
-- Or manually create the missing functions:
SELECT * FROM pg_proc WHERE proname IN ('search_artists', 'get_setlist_with_votes', 'get_user_vote');
```

### 2. RLS Policy Fix (High Priority)
```sql
-- Review and fix public write access policies
-- Ensure only authenticated users can insert/update/delete
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can insert artists" ON artists;
CREATE POLICY "Only admins can insert artists" ON artists FOR INSERT 
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin');
```

### 3. Voting System Fix (Medium Priority)
```sql
-- Ensure proper UUID handling for votes
-- Add proper error handling for foreign key constraints
```
