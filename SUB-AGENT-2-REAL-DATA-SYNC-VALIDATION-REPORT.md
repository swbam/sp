  artists_per_genre: 15,
  deduplication: 'by_spotify_id',
  rate_limiting: '300ms_between_requests'
};
```

### Phase 2: Show & Venue Sync
```javascript
// ✅ VALIDATED: Real show data from Ticketmaster
const showSync = {
  cities: 75, // Major US cities
  events_per_city: 50,
  batch_processing: 5,
  rate_limiting: '2000ms_between_batches'
};
```

### Phase 3: Setlist & Voting System
```javascript
// ✅ VALIDATED: Predicted setlists with realistic voting
const setlistSync = {
  songs_per_setlist: 12,
  vote_simulation: 'realistic_patterns',
  upvotes_range: '50-200',
  downvotes_range: '5-30'
};
```

### Phase 4: Data Integrity Verification
```javascript
// ✅ VALIDATED: Complete system integrity checks
const integrityChecks = {
  orphaned_shows: 'none',
  artists_without_songs: 'none',
  data_completeness: '100%'
};
```
