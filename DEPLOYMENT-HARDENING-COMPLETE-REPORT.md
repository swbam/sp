**Advanced Capabilities:**
```yaml
# Dynamic deployment strategy selection
deployment_strategy:
  type: choice
  options: [blue-green, canary, rolling]

# Automated rollback on failure
rollback_on_failure:
  default: true
  
# Comprehensive security scanning

  return async (...args) => {
    const transaction = Sentry.startTransaction({
      name,
      op: 'function',
    });
    // ... monitoring logic
  };
};

// Custom metrics tracking
export const recordMetric = (name, value, unit = 'none', tags = {}) => {
  Sentry.metrics.distribution(name, value, {
    unit,
    tags: {
      environment: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV,
      ...tags,
    },

    responseTime: 0,
    errorCount: 0,
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const eventSource = new EventSource('/api/monitoring/realtime');
    eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
      const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
      setMetrics(data);
    };
    return () => eventSource.close();

  // 2. Build green deployment
  const greenDeployment = await this.buildGreenDeployment();
  
  // 3. Deploy to green environment
  await this.deployToGreen(greenDeployment);
  
  // 4. Health check green deployment
  await this.healthCheckGreen(greenDeployment);
  
  // 5. Switch traffic to green
  await this.switchTrafficToGreen(greenDeployment);
  
  // 6. Validate production traffic

  { name: 'JWT Secret', pattern: /jwt[_-]?secret\s*[:=]\s*['""]([^'""]+)['""]/, severity: 'critical' },
  { name: 'Private Key', pattern: /-----BEGIN\s+(?:RSA\s+)?PRIVATE\s+KEY-----/, severity: 'critical' },
];

// Security anti-patterns detection
const antiPatterns = [
  { name: 'eval() usage', pattern: /\beval\s*\(/, severity: 'high' },
  { name: 'innerHTML usage', pattern: /\.innerHTML\s*=/, severity: 'medium' },
  { name: 'document.write usage', pattern: /document\.write\s*\(/, severity: 'medium' },
];
```

### 6. Disaster Recovery System

- **Disaster recovery testing** with automated procedures

**Recovery Capabilities:**
```javascript
async restoreFromBackup(backupId, options = {}) {
  // 1. Validate backup exists
  const backupManifest = await this.loadBackupManifest(backupId);
  
  // 2. Restore database
  if (options.includeDatabase) {
    await this.restoreDatabase(backupManifest);
  }
  
  // 3. Restore application files
  if (options.includeFiles) {
    await this.restoreApplicationFiles(backupManifest);
  }
  
  // 4. Restore configurations
  if (options.includeConfigurations) {
    await this.restoreConfigurations(backupManifest);
  }
  
  // 5. Validate restore
  await this.validateRestore();
}
```
